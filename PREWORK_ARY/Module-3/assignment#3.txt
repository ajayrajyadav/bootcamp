Finding a squad would be the hardest thing for me. By nature I am an intravert. I have come a long way from my intravert tendencies ever since I became a manager, but I know it is still hard for me to go talk to people. I will do my hardest to find my squad in this class. 
Another Issue I see is that I may neglect my health. I am notorious for pulling all nighters when needed, weather it is for collage, work or when my kids were born. I will do my best to be able to plan this in advance and hopefully be on top of it to be able to mitigate the situation if it arises.
