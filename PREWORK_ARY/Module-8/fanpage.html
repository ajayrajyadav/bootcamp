<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Yadav Girls are 3 vibrant beautiful girls who like to enjoy life. The oldest one, Anjuli, who was born in 2010, is the most sensitive with the biggest heart ever. She really likes school and perticulary math problems. She really likes to read as well.</p>
<p>The middle girl, Avani, born in 2013, has a very different personality then Anjuli. She thinks practicing math is boring and she would rather watch a show on netflix then keep tracing or writing numbers over and over. She writes most of the numbers backwards when she is in hurry. Her nickname is Brava, because she is very brave, she is not afraid of pain, she has total of 3 baby teeth fall out and all of them she has asked me to pull them becasue she no longer wanted them in her mouth.</p>
<p>The youngest, Aryana, born in 2016, is another brave girl, who is scared of vacuum but rather ride it then run away from it. She has started to talk but she thinks the words that she is speaking make complete sense but they don't. She loves to play with older sister's toys then her own. She likes to make a mess in Avani's room but does not want to clean it.</p>
<p>Last but not least is Daisy, our dog was adopted in 2009, she is the biggest sister of all. She love to play fetch with the tennis ball eventhough it does not fit her. She loves to fetch so much that once she played with it for whole hour and got so tired that she slept for 14 hours straight. </p>
